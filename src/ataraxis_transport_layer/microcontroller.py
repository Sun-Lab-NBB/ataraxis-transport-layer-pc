class ModuleInterface:  # pragma: no cover
    """The base class from which all custom ModuleInterface classes should inherit.

    Inheriting from this class grants all subclasses the static API that the MicroControllerInterface class uses to
    interface with specific modules. In addition to the inherited API, each ModuleInterface subclass should encapsulate
    module-specific parameters and data handling methods unique for each module family. See Notes for more details.

    Notes:
        Due to a high degree of custom module variability, it is currently not possible to provide a 'one-fits-all'
        module Interface that is also highly efficient for real time communication. Therefore, similar to
        ataraxis-micro-controller (AXMC) library, the interface for each custom module has to be implemented separately
        on a need-base method. The (base) class exposes the static API that MicroControllerInterface class can use to
        integrate each custom interface implementation with the general communication runtime cycle. To make this
        integration possible, this class defines some abstract (pure virtual) methods that developers have to implement
        for their interfaces. Follow the implementation guidelines in the docstrings of each abstract method and check
        the default modules included with the library distribution for guidance.

        When inheriting from this class, remember to call the parent's init method in the child class init method by
        using 'super().__init__()'! If this is not done, the MicroControllerInterface class will likely not be able to
        properly interact with your ModuleInterface!

        All data received from or sent to the microcontroller is automatically logged as byte-serialized numpy arrays.
        Therefore, if you do not need any additional processing steps, such as sending or receiving data from Unity,
        do not enable any custom processing flags. You will, however, have to implement all abstract methods, even if
        the class instance does not use them due to its flag-configuration.

    Args:
        module_type: The id-code that describes the broad type (family) of Modules managed by this interface class. This
            value has to match the code used by the module implementation on the microcontroller. Valid byte-codes range
            from 1 to 255.
        type_name: The human-readable name for the type (family) of Modules managed by this interface class, e.g.:
            'Rotary_Encoder'. This name is used in messages and some log files to help human operators in identifying
            the module family.
        module_id: The code that identifies the specific Module instance managed by the Interface class instance. This
            is used to identify unique instances of the same module family, such as different rotary encoders if more
            than one is used at the same time. Valid byte-codes range from 1 to 255.
        instance_name: The human-readable name for the specific Module instance managed by the Interface class instance,
            e.g.: 'Left_Corner_Touch_Sensor'. This name is used in messages and some log files to help human operators
            in identifying the module instance.
        unity_input_topics: A list of MQTT topics used by Unity to send commands to the module accessible through this
            Interface instance. If the module should not receive commands from Unity, set to None. This list will be
            used to initialize the UnityCommunication class instance to monitor the requested topics. If the module
            supports receiving commands from Unity, use get_from_unity() method to implement the logic for accessing
            and handling the incoming commands.
        output_data: Determines whether the module accessible through this Interface instance sends data to Unity or
            other processes. If the module is designed to output data in addition to logging it, use send_data()
            method to implement the logic for pre-processing and sending the data.

    Attributes:
        _module_type: Stores the type (family) of the interfaced module.
        _type_name: Stores the human-readable name of the module type (family).
        _module_id: Stores the specific module instance ID within the broader type (family).
        _instance_name: Stores the human-readable name of the specific module instance.
        _type_id: Stores the type and id combined into a single uint16 value. This value should be unique for all
            possible type-id pairs and is used to ensure that each used module instance has a unique ID-type
            combination.
        _output_data: Determines whether the instance outputs data to Unity or other processes.
        _unity_input: Determines whether to receive commands from Unity.
        _unity_input_topics: Stores the list of Unity topics to monitor for incoming commands.

class MicroControllerInterface:  # pragma: no cover
    """Facilitates bidirectional communication between an Arduino or Teensy microcontroller, Python processes, and Unity
    game engine.

    This class contains the logic that sets up a remote daemon process with SerialCommunication, UnityCommunication,
    and DataLogger bindings to facilitate bidirectional communication and data logging between Unity, Python, and the
    microcontroller. Additionally, it exposes methods that send runtime parameters and commands to the Kernel and
    Module classes running on the connected microcontroller.

    Notes:
        An instance of this class has to be instantiated for each microcontroller active at the same time. The
        communication will not be started until the start() method of the class instance is called.

        This class uses SharedMemoryArray to control the runtime of the remote process, which makes it impossible to
        have more than one instance of this class with the same controller_name at a time. Make sure the class instance
        is stopped (to free SharedMemory buffer) before attempting to initialize a new class instance.

        During it's initialization, the class generates two unique log entry types. First, it builds and logs the map
        of all ID codes (controller, module-type, module-instance) to their human-readable names that follows the
        controller-module_type-module_instance hierarchy. Other Ataraxis libraries use this data to deserialize the
        logs into a human-readable dataset format. Second, for each managed ModuleInterface instance, the class calls
        its log_variables() method and logs the returned data if it is not None. These types of logs can be identified
        based on their unique timestamp values: 18446744073709551615 for variables and 18446744073709551614 for
        controller maps. These values are not meaningful as timestamps, instead they function as special identifiers.

    Args:
        controller_id: The unique identifier code of the managed microcontroller. This information is hardcoded via the
            AtaraxisMicroController (AXMC) firmware running on the microcontroller, and this class ensures that the code
            used by the connected microcontroller matches this argument when the connection is established. Critically,
            this code is also used as the source_id for the data sent from this class to the DataLogger. Therefore, it
            is important for this code to be unique across ALL concurrently active Ataraxis data producers, such as:
            microcontrollers, video systems, and Unity game engine instances. Valid codes are values between 1 and 255.
        controller_name: The human-readable name of the connected microcontroller. This information is used to better
            identify the microcontroller to human operators in error messages and log files.
        controller_usb_port: The serial USB port to which the microcontroller is connected. This information is used to
            set up the bidirectional serial communication with the controller. You can use list_available_ports()
            function from this library to discover addressable USB ports to pass to this argument.
        data_logger: An initialized DataLogger instance that will be used to log the data produced by this Interface
            instance. The DataLogger itself is NOT managed by this instance and will need to be activated separately.
            This instance only extracts the necessary information to buffer the data to the logger.
        modules: A tuple of classes that inherit from the (base) ModuleInterface class. These classes will be used by
            the main runtime cycle to handle the incoming data from the modules running on the microcontroller.
        baudrate: The baudrate at which the serial communication should be established. This argument is ignored
            for microcontrollers that use the USB communication protocol, such as most Teensy boards. The correct
            baudrate for microcontrollers using the UART communication protocol depends on the clock speed of the
            microcontroller's CPU and the supported UART revision. Setting this to an unsupported value for
            microcontrollers that use UART will result in communication errors.
        maximum_transmitted_payload_size: The maximum size of the message payload that can be sent to the
            microcontroller as one message. This should match the microcontroller's serial reception buffer size, even
            if the actual transmitted payloads do not reach that size. If the size is not set right, you may run into
            communication errors.
        unity_broker_ip: The ip address of the MQTT broker used for Unity communication. Typically, this would be a
            'virtual' ip-address of the locally running MQTT broker, but the class can carry out cross-machine
            communication if necessary. Unity communication will only be initialized if any of the input modules
            requires this functionality.
        unity_broker_port: The TCP port of the MQTT broker used for Unity communication. This is used in conjunction
            with the unity_broker_ip argument to connect to the MQTT broker.
        verbose: Determines whether the communication cycle reports runtime progress, including the contents of all
            incoming and outgoing messages, by printing messages to the console. This option is used during debugging
            and should be disabled during production runtimes.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If any of the input arguments are not of the expected type.

            _mp_manager: Stores the multiprocessing Manager used to initialize and manage input and output Queue
                objects.

                the communication process.
            _output_queue: Stores the multiprocessing Queue used to output the data received from the microcontroller to
                other processes.
            _terminator_array: Stores the SharedMemoryArray instance used to control the runtime of the remote
                communication process.
            _communication_process: Stores the (remote) Process instance that runs the communication cycle.
            _watchdog_thread: A thread used to monitor the runtime status of the remote communication process.
            _reset_command: Stores the pre-packaged Kernel-addressed command that resets the microcontroller's hardware

        This method is designed to run in a remote Process. It encapsulates the steps for sending and receiving the
        data from the connected microcontroller. Primarily, the method routes the data between the microcontroller and
        the multiprocessing queues (inpout and output) managed by the Interface instance and Unity game engine
        (via the binding of an MQTT client). Additionally, it manages data logging by interfacing with the DataLogger
        class via the logger_queue.

        Args:
            controller_id: The byte-code identifier of the target microcontroller. This is used to ensure that the
                instance interfaces with the correct controller.
            modules: A tuple that stores ModuleInterface classes managed by this MicroControllerInterface instance.
            input_queue: The multiprocessing queue used to issue commands to the microcontroller.
            output_queue: The multiprocessing queue used to pipe received data to other processes.
            logger_queue: The queue exposed by the DataLogger class that is used to buffer and pipe received and
                outgoing messages to be logged (saved) to disk.
            terminator_array: The shared memory array used to control the communication process runtime.
            usb_port: The serial port to which the target microcontroller is connected.
            baudrate: The communication baudrate to use. This option is ignored for controllers that use USB interface,
                 but is essential for controllers that use the UART interface.
            payload_size: The maximum size of the payload the managed microcontroller can receive. This is used to
                ensure all outgoing messages fit inside the Serial reception buffer of the microcontroller.
            unity_ip: The IP-address of the MQTT broker to use for communication with Unity game engine.
            unity_port: The port number of the MQTT broker to use for communication with Unity game engine.
            verbose: A flag that determines whether the contents of the incoming and outgoing messages should be
                printed to console. This is only used during debugging and should be disabled during most runtimes.
