/**
 * @file
 * @brief The header file for the CRCProcessor class, which is used to verify transmitted data integrity by calculating
 * the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Checksum for the outgoing and incoming data packets.
 *
 * @subsection description Description:
 * Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is a widely used algorithm for verifying data integrity that is based on the residual
 * obtained from dividing the byte-serialized data array by a polynomial. A well known property of the CRC algorithm is
 * that running the CRC calculation on a packet that contains the CRC checksum at the end always returns 0 as the CRC
 * checksum.
 *
 * For more information about CRC see this original paper:
 * W. W. Peterson and D. T. Brown, "Cyclic Codes for Error Detection," in Proceedings of the IRE, vol. 49, no. 1,
 * pp. 228-235, Jan. 1961, @a doi: 10.1109/JRPROC.1961.287814.
 *
 * This file contains four major methods packaged into the COBSProcessor class namespace:
 * - CalculatePacketCRCChecksum(): A CRC checksum calculator that uses a class-specific CRC lookup table generated
 * during class instantiation to speed up it's runtime.
 * - AddCRCChecksumToBuffer(): A packager method that converts an input CRC checksum into bytes and adds them to the
 * specified location of the input buffer.
 * - ReadCRCChecksumFromBuffer(): An unpackager method that extracts a CRC checksum from the specified location of the
 * input buffer and returns it as an appropriately-sized unsigned integer.
 * - GenerateCRCTable(): A private method automatically called during class instantiation that calculates a constant
 * CRC-lookup table used to speed up checksum calculation at the cost of reserving a certain amount of RAM.
 * - A number of other minor utility methods used by the major method listed above.
 *
 * @attention This class is implemented as a template and many methods adapt to the PolynomialType argument used during
 * class instantiation. See developer notes below for more information.
 *
 * @subsection developer_notes Developer Notes:
 * This class is implemented as a template and all of it's methods scale with the CRC polynomial type used during class
 * instantiation. This allows using the same class for all common polynomials used for CRC checksum calculations of
 * types uint8_t, uint16_t and uint32_t. This is part of a boarder effort to make the library sufficiently flexible to
 * be used on a wide variety of platforms, from the generally constrained Arduino Uno to the relatively forgiving
 * Teensy 4.1 (the library has been tested on this specific board).
 *
 * The class currently does not support 64-bit polynomials, as uint64_t is not supported by the lower-end Arduino boards
 * and also relatively infrequently used in embedded systems development. It may be implemented in the future if enough
 * interest is expressed or a community contributor adds support for this functionality.
 *
 * Due to the complex nature of class definition, the class can only be instantiated by an instantiation-time
 * assignment:
 * @code
 * CRCProcessor<uint16_t> crc_class(0x1021, 0xFFFF, 0x0000);
 * @endcode
 * It is important to use the same template type argument as used by the polynomial (first argument of the class
 * constructor), as the class automatically scales all constructor arguments to the declared polynomial type template
 * parameter.
 *
 * @subsection dependencies Dependencies:
 * - Arduino.h for Arduino platform methods and macros and cross-compatibility with Arduino IDE (to an extent).
 * - cstring for std namespace.
 * - stdint.h for fixed-width integer types. Using stdint.h instead of cstdint for compatibility (with Arduino) reasons.
 * - stp_shared_assets.h for shared library assets (mostly status byte-codes for library classes).
 *
 * @attention Due to the use of templates to improve class safety and versatility, this class only exists as an .h file
 * with no matching .cpp file. While templates can be defined in a .tpp, for embedded programming it is easier to use
 * the .h file.

/**
 * @class CRCProcessor
 * @brief Generates a Circular Redundancy Check table during initialization and provides methods that use this table to
 * calculate the CRC checksum and add / read this checksum from storage buffers for transmitted data packets.
 *
 * @warning All methods of this class scale with the PolynomialType template argument of the class. Make sure that this
 * argument matches the used polynomial type during class instantiation to avoid unexpected behavior.
 *
 * @note Each instance of this class computes a constant CRC table during initialization and subsequently uses it to
 * generate CRC checksum values for input data byte-streams. The table reserves either 256, 512 or 1024 bytes of memory
 * depending on the PolynomialType template parameter. As such, it is costly (and uncommon) to instantiate more
 * than a single instance of the class, as each instance will create its' own table.
 *
 * @attention This class makes certain assumptions about the layout of the input buffers and, additionally, is very
 * sensitive to the correct constructor configuration (due to the high versatility of CRC-table generation method). Due
 * to these reasons, this class is intended to be used exclusively by the SerializedTransferProtocol class, which
 * appropriately handles all assumptions and configuration requirements.
 *
 * @tparam PolynomialType The datatype of the CRC polynomial to be used by the class. Valid types are uint8_t, uint16_t
 * and uint32_t. The class contains a compile-time guard against any other input datatype. Overall, this allows to use
 * this class with the vast majority of available CRC checksum polynomials, significantly increasing use versatility.
 *
 * Example instantiation:
 * @code
 * uint16_t polynomial = 0x1021;
 * uint16_t initial_value = 0xFFFF;
 * uint16_t final_xor_value = 0x0000;
 * CRCProcessor<uin16_t> crc_class(polynomial, initial_value, final_xor_value);

     *
     * This method loops over packet_size bytes starting with start_index inside the buffer and iteratively computes a

     * The method is primarily intended to be used on the buffers of the SerializedTransferProtocol class and was

     *
     * @note Currently, only supports polynomials that do not require bit-reversal for inputs and outputs.
     *
     * @attention The method packages the generated CRC checksum to the type specified by the PolynomialType template
     * argument of the class. As such, it automatically scales with each supported polynomial type. Make sure that the
     * caller uses the appropriate type (or auto) to handle the returned checksum value.
     *
     * @warning Any value returned by this method is potentially a valid value. To determine if the method runtime was
     * successful or failed, use crc_status variable of the class instance. Unlike for many other methods of this
     * library, the returned value is not meaningful until it is verified using the status code.
     *
     * @tparam buffer_size The size of the input buffer. This value is used to verify that the requested packet_size
     * fits inside the buffer and will not lead to an out-of-bounds access. This guards against undefined behavior and
     * potential data corruption.
     * @param buffer The buffer that stores the data to be checksummed. This is intended to be a well-formed and
     * COBS-encoded packet to be sent to the PC using SerializedTransferProtocol class. That said, the method will checksum
     * any valid byte-array.
     * @param start_index The index that points to the first byte-value of the portion of the data inside the input
     * buffer to be checksummed (where to start check-summing from). This is helpful to limit the checksum calculation
     * if the buffer contains additional data prior to the portion to be checksummed.
     * @param packet_size The byte-size (stretch) of the data to be checksummed. This method works from start_index (see
     * above) inside the input buffer up to the last index defined by this value (packet_size-1). This is helpful if the
     * buffer contains additional data after the data portion to be checksummed.
     *
     * @returns PolynomialType The CRC checksum of the requested data cast to appropriate type based on the polynomial
     * type (uint8_t, uint16_t or uint32_t). Make sure to use the crc_status class variable to determine the success or
